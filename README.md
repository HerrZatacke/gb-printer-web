## Development usage
The following options apply if you plan on contributing to this app:

### Environment Variables

#### Development
```bash
# Development WiFi proxy host (for local development with WiFi devices)
NEXT_DEV_WIFI_PROXY_HOST=192.168.0.5
```

#### Self-hosting (with or without subfolders)
```bash
# Endpoint for environment configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_ENDPOINT="/env.json"

# Base path for deployment (leave empty for root deployment, use leading slash otherwise like "/gb-printer-web")
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=""
```
Self hosting the webapp including dropbox sync requires you create a dropbox app through the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/)  
Create the app as a *"Scoped App (App Folder)"*
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DROPBOX_APP_KEY="<your_app_key>"
NEXT_PUBLIC_DROPBOX_APP_PATH="/home/Apps/<your_app_folder_name>/"
```

### Local Setup
This is a standard Next.js project. Clone the repository, install dependencies with `npm install`, and run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

Set up environment variables in `.env.local` if needed (see above).
