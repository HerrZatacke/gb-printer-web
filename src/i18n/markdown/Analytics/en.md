I could use your help to make this tool better!

To understand how people use it, I’d like to _collect anonymous usage statistics_ like:
* how often the app is used
* how many images are approximately stored
* selected settings and their effects
* where things might be slowing down.

I’d also like to gather anonymous error reports, so if something goes wrong, I can spot common issues and fix them faster.

None of this data includes _any personal information_ or even the actual _content of your images_.  
I just need some general info to help improve performance and reliability.

Would you be okay with that? (_You can change your opinion later in the settings_)
